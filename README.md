Quickly configure and start AWS CloudFormation stacks.

## Features

- CLI parameter prompting for easy configuration
- Persists parameters in local config files for easy reuse and version control
- Library functions to include functionality into other projects

## CLI

cfn-config includes CLI commands for working with CloudFormation stacks.

### Installation

Install globally with `npm` to use CLI commands:

```
$ npm install -g cfn-config
```

### Configuration

cfn-config commands need access to the CloudFormation API to read, create,
update, and delete stacks. Add `~/.cfnrc` with the following properties:

```
{
    "accessKeyId": "xxxx",
    "secretAccessKey": "xxxx"
}
```

### Secure Parameters

Optionally, you may provide the path to an RSA key in your `~/.cfnrc` file. If you do so, `NoEcho` parameters in your Cloudformation template will be encrypted using the key before being saves to a configuration file. 

If you are using an existing config file to start or update a Cloudformation stack, and if that config file contains encrypted parameters, **you must** provide the path to the RSA private key capable of decrypting those parameters. Otherwise, the encrypted strings will be provided to Cloudformation directly.

To ask cfn-config to use your private key, specify a `secureKey` property in your `~/.cfnrc` file. For example:

```
{
    "accessKeyId": "xxxx",
    "secretAccessKey": "xxxx",
    "secureKey": "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

### Usage

The following commands are available. Run each with `--help` for specific
instructions.

- `cfn-config` - Configures a stack's parameters based on a CFN template file.
  Writes the configuration to disk, but does not start the stack.
- `cfn-create` - Configures a stack's parameters based on a CFN template file.
  Write the configuration to disk and starts the given stack.
- `cfn-delete` - Delete the given stack.
- `cfn-info` - Returns parameters and output for the given stack.
- `cfn-update` - Configures a stack's parameters based on a CFN template file.
  Writes the configuration to disk and updates the given stack to use the new
  parameters and template.

## Library

Include cfn-config into your project to incorporate/extend its functionality.

### Installation

Add to your project's package.json by running the following from your project's
directory:

```
$ npm install --save cfn-config
```

### Usage

#### `config.setCredentials(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey)`

Set the AWS credentials to be used by the library.

#### `config.configStack(options, callback)`

Reusable function for determining configuration.

`options` object should include:
- template: Required. Path to the Cloudformation template
- region: The AWS region to deploy into
- name: Required. Name of the Cloudformation stack
- config: Optional. Path to a configuration file to use
- update: Defaults to false. Reads existing stack parameters.
- defaults, choices, messages, filters: Optional. Any of these properties can be set to an object where the keys are Cloudformation parameter names, and the values are as described by https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#question

##### How defaults behave

The configuration process prompts you for each parameter in the given template.
For each value, cfn-config will determine a default value using the following
priority:

1. Value from an existing stack if one with the given name already exists
1. Value provided by a requiring library
1. Value from a configuration file one exists for the stack with the given name
1. `Default` property set on the parameter in the template

#### `config.stackInfo(options, callback)`

Finds details about a running Cloudformation stack

`options` object should include:
- name: Required. Name of the Cloudformation stack
- region: The AWS region to deploy into
- resources: Defaults to false. Gets information about resources in the stack
